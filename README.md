Here's an explanation of the code:

    We import the cv2 module and load the pre-trained face detection classifier provided by OpenCV (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml). This classifier is used to detect human faces in the video frames.

    We initialize the video capture using cv2.VideoCapture(). You can pass 0 to use the default camera or specify the path to a video file if you want to process a recorded video.

    Inside the main loop, we continuously read frames from the video source.

    We convert each frame to grayscale for face detection because the face detection algorithm works on grayscale images.

    The face_cascade.detectMultiScale method is used to detect faces in the grayscale frame. Detected faces are stored in the faces variable as a list of rectangles (x, y, width, height).

    For each detected face, we extract the region of interest (ROI) containing the face.

    We apply Gaussian blur to the face ROI using cv2.GaussianBlur to blur the face.

    Finally, we replace the original face in the frame with the blurred face.

    We display the resulting frame with the blurred faces using cv2.imshow.

    The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point the program releases the video capture object and closes all OpenCV windows.
